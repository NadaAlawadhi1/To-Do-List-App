# ✅ ToDo App

A simple and modern **ToDo app** built with **Flutter**, designed to help users manage daily tasks with a clean and intuitive interface.  
The app originally supported **online task storage** through an external API, but the API is currently unavailable—so saving and retrieving tasks is temporarily disabled.  
All screenshots below focus on the UI only.
