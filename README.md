✅ ToDo App
A simple and modern ToDo app built with Flutter. Designed to help users manage daily tasks with a clean UI and optional online storage.

⚠️ Note: This app was originally connected to an external API for saving tasks. That API is currently unavailable, so task saving and retrieval are disabled. Screenshots only display the app's interface — not the actual task list view.

📱 Screenshots
UI previews only (to-do activity screen not included due to API issue)
